      <description>The tZq signal is observed with a significance well over five standard deviations. Machine Learning algorithm, gradient boosted decision trees (BDTs) are set up to maximally discriminate between prompt and non-prompt leptons. The BDTs exploit the properties of the jet closest to the lepton in terms of ∆R The measured tZq production cross section is in agreement with the standard model expectation. Python implementation of ROOT TMVA (cern machine learning and data analysis platform) used.</description>

      <title>Search for tZq Using BDT</title>

      <description>A search for the associated production of a top quark and a Z boson (tZq), as predicted by theory was performed with the full CMS data set collected at 8TeV. In order to enhance the separation between signal and background processes, a multivariate discriminator is used in both the tZq-SM and FCNC searches. A range of different quantities are used as input variables for the BDTs. They are selected based on their discriminating power and include kinematic variables related to the top quark and the Z boson The BDTs are trained using half of the simulated samples for these processes and they are trained separately for each channel.</description>

      <description>Two multivariate discriminators, based on observables from the 1bjet and 2bjets regions, are used to enhance the separation be- tween signal and background processes.
The discriminators are based on the BDT algorithm implemented in the toolkit for multivariate analysis TMVA. The BDT is trained using the simulated samples.
The predictions for some of the most discriminating variables in the BDT for the 1bjet and 2bjets regions are compared to data</description>
